# Code to reproduce the analyses of "Fungal Biodiversity Mediates the Effects of Drying on Freshwater Ecosystem Functioning"

In this paper, we combined observational and manipulative experiments to analyse how fungal biodiversity responds to and mediates the impacts of drying on two key ecosystem processes: organic matter decomposition and fungal biomass accrual. Our observational dataset consists of fungal biodiversity and ecosystem processes from 15 streams spanning a natural gradient of flow intermittence. Our manipulative design evaluates the responses of ecosystem processes to two fungal richness levels crossed with three levels of drying.  

This code re-creates analysis of the field and experimental data
